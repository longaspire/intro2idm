\frametitle{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Pervasive use of RFID devices as a support for object tracking
  \begin{fitemize}
    \item monitoring of people, animals and objects inside museums, schools, hospital etc.
    \item context-aware information.
  \end{fitemize}
  \item There exists ambiguity in the raw RFID data.
  \begin{fitemize}
    \item no one-to-one correspondence between locations and readers, no way to deterministically decide the location given that a set of readers detected an object.
    \item the same location may constrain different reader's detection zones, the same reader may detect different objects at different locations, also false negatives~\cite{DBLP:conf/edbt/FazzingaFFP14}.
  \end{fitemize}

\frametitle{The Problem Setting for This Work}

\fsize{

An instance of \conceptbf{smoothing problem}~\cite{smith2013sequential}: estimating the state of an observed entity at a time point $t \in [1...T]$ on the basis of all the observations over $[1...T]$ in terms of a posterior probability distribution over the possible states.\\~\\

This work proposes a smoothing technique following a two-way-filtering scheme that embeds a sampling strategy for efficiently dealing with missing detections.\\~\\

In the first \emph{forward} phase, time points are processed from the first to the last, and the possible positions at each time point are filtered by taking into account the results of the previous steps.\\~\\

In the \emph{backward} phase, it proceeds from the last to the first time point: for each time point, filter the positions detected as admissible in the forward phase and revise their weights, by checking whether they are a valid position when looking at the results obtained for the future time point.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Problem Setting for This Work}

\fsize{

The map of the locations is assumed to be partitioned according to a grid, thus the positions to be filtered and weighted at each step of the forward phase are the grid cells compatible with the readers that performed the detection.\\~\\

Thus, the grid cells may result in too many candidate positions, a variant of the cleaning algorithm where missing detections are treated by integrating the grid-based approach with sampling strategy is proposed.\\~\\

At the end of each forward step involving a missing detection, the cells that survived the filtering are further filtered according to a sampling technique, where the probability of a cell to be sampled is an estimate of the probability it would have been assigned if it was considered also in the following phases.

Assume the set $\mathcal{R} = \{ r_1,...,r_n \}$ of readers, and the set $\mathcal{L} = \{ L_1,...,L_n \}$ of locations on map $M$.\\~\\ \pause

The map of locations is partitioned according to a regular grid, whose generic cell will be denoted as $c$. The set of cells intersecting the area covered by a set $R \in \mathcal{R}$ of readers will be denoted as $Cells(R)$. \\~\\ \pause

A \emph{detection-sequence} (d-sequence for short) $D$ over time interval $I$ is a sequence $R_1,...,R_T$, where $R_t \subset \mathcal{R}$ (with $t \in [1...T]$) is the (possibly empty) set of readers that detected $o$ at time point $t$.

\begin{problem}[The Cleaning Problem]
  Given a d-sequence $D = R_1,...R_T$, representing the sets of readers that consecutively detected object $o$ while it was moving over the time interval $I = [1...T]$ and over the map $M$, the \emph{cleaning problem} addressed in this work is that of estimating the actual position (at the granularity level of location) of $o$ at each $t \in I$. This will be accomplished by modeling the position of $o$ at $t$ as a random variable over $\mathcal{L}$, and providing a posterior PDF $p_t$ which is conditional to the relevant evidence encoded by the d-sequence $D$. The output of this cleaning task is the sequence $p_1,...p_T$ of these posterior PDFs, and will be called \emph{probabilistic trajectory} (p-trajectory) over time interval $I$.

\frametitle{The Cleaning Algorithm}

\begin{block}{A Motion Model for estimating the probability of movements}
  Given two cells $c, c'$, to estimate the probability that object $o$ has reached $c'$ starting from $c$ in a certain amount of time. To this end, we exploit the knowledge of $v_{max}$, and we assume that the possible speeds of $o$ are uniformly distributed over $[0,v_{max}]$. Then, denoting the probability that the speed of $o$ is at least $x$ as $p^{mov}(v \geq x)$, we estimate the probability that $o$ reached $c'$ from $c$ in time $\Delta$ as the probability that $o$ had at least the speed needed to walk through the shortest path from $c$ to $c'$ in time $\Delta$, i.e., $p^{mov} (v \geq d_{min}(c,c')/\Delta)$.
\end{block}

\textit{\textrm{this way, the probability in motion model takes into account both the maximum speed and the topology of the map (that implies the value of $d_{min}$).}}

Even if $C(t-1)$ and $v_{max}$ are such that the size of $C(t)$ is smaller than the number of cells covered by one reader, it is easy to see that, in the presence of a sequence of $m$ missing detections starting at time $t$, the size of $C(t+m)$ may become extremely large.

\textbf{Embedding a sampling strategy} aims at preventing the explosion of the cardinality of the set of cells considered as possible position at each time point.\\~\\

In case of a missing detection at time $t$, after evaluating $C(t)$ and the forward probabilities of its cells as in the standard forward phase, filter $C(t)$ according to a \emph{sampling technique}.\\~\\

A \textbf{naive approach} for choosing $k$ good representives for the cells in $C(t)$ is that of sampling $k$ cells on the basis of their computed forward probabilities. (\textit{however, those ``high'' forward probabilities cells may turn out to be impossible or unlikely position due to the future positions.})\\~\\

\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sampling-based Approach}

A \textbf{reasonable way} to select $k$ representatives is that of sampling them according to their posterior probability (i.e., $p_t$), as it takes into account the past, present and future states. (\textit{however, $p_t(c)$ is unknown at this stage of algorithm.})\\~\\

\emph{Using a Good Estimation $\widetilde{p}_t(c)$ of $p_t(c)$} \quad $p_t(c)$ is given by the product of three terms: $p_t^{fw}(c)$, $p_t^{bw}(c)$ and the likelihood $h(\varnothing|c)$ that $o$ was detected by no reader when it's at cell $c$.\\~\\

$p_t^{fw}(c)$ and $h(\varnothing|c)$ can be computed at this stage, thus, in order to estimate $\widetilde{p}_t(c)$, it suffices to devise a mechanism to estimate the backward probability $p_t^{bw}(c)$.

\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Estimating $p_t^{bw}(c)$ In Forward Phase}

Denoting as $t'$ the first time point after $t$ when $o$ was detected by at least one reader ($R_{t'} \neq \varnothing$), to estimate $p_t^{bw}(c)$,  consider the cell $c'$ closest to $c$ among those covered by $R_{t'}$. Then, take as estimate $\widetilde{p}_t^{bw}(c)$ of $p_t^{bw}(c)$ the probability:\\~\\

\pause

\begin{equation}
  p^{mov}(v \geq \frac{d_{min}(c,c')}{(t'-t)\cdot\Delta})
\end{equation}

\pause

i.e., the probability that $o$ has least the minimum speed for moving from $c$ to $c'$ between the time $t \sim t'$.\\~\\

\textit{the reason for using thie value is that the higher the probablity, the larger the number $x$ of cells in $Cells(R_{t'})$ that are likely to be reachable in the time elaspsed between $t$ and $t'$.}

\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sampling-based Approach}

Hence, for each cell $c \in C(t)$, $p_t(c)$ is estimated with:\\~\\

\begin{equation}
  \widetilde{p}_t(c) = p_t^{fw}(c) \times h(\varnothing|c) \times \widetilde{p}_t^{bw}(c)
\end{equation}\\~\\

and this value is used to rank the cells in $C(t)$, so that the $k$ cells having the greatest estimated probablities are selected as representives of $C(t)$.

  \item lines 9--11: the first time point $t'$ afte $t$ when $o$ was detected is computed, the cell $c'$ for each cell $c$ in $Cells(R_{t'})$ (closest to $c$) is computed.
  \item lines 12--13: the estimate $\widetilde{p}^{bw}_t(c)$ is evaluated and therefore the $\widetilde{p}_t(c)$ is evaluated by assembling $p_t^{fw}(c)$, $p_t^{bw}(c)$ and $h(\varnothing|c)$.
  \item line 14: it selects the top-$k$ cells of $C(t)$ by invoking funtion $top_k$.

  the algorithm obtains $t' = 4$ as the first time point after $t = 2$ for which $R_{t'} \neq \varnothing$. The following three actions are performed: 1. the cell $c'$ -- of $Cells(4)$ which is the closest to $c$ -- $o4$ and $o5$ (for each $c$) are determined; 2. the estimate $\widetilde{p}_2^{bw}(c)$ of the backward probability is computed, $\widetilde{p}_2^{bw}(c)$ results to be greater than 0 only for the cross-marked cells. Since $g2,g3,h3$ are covered by reader $r$, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood $h(\varnothing | c)$ is lower than other cross-marked cells; 3. the $top_k$ function chooses the cells that belong to the set of cross-marked cells not intersecting $r$'s range.

\frametitle{Conclusions}

A two-way filtering approach is proposed for translating the readings collected for RFID-traked moving objects into positions over a map.\\~\\

The technique combines a grid-based filtering strategy with a sampling-based technique, tailored at limiting the number of positions considered as alternatives.
