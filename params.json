  "body": "## Welcome to ***Literature Repository for Indoor Data Management***\r\nIndoor spaces may accommodate very large populations of moving individuals. In fact, people spend large parts of their lives in indoor spaces such as private homes, office buildings, shopping malls, conference facilities, airports, and subway stations.\r\n\r\n*Indoor Positioning Systems* built by multiple wireless technologies and their produced mobility data have attracted wide attention from various research communities and industries. Anti-terrorist missions, customer engagements, disaster aids, logistics, manufacturing, urban transportation, medical services, and many other businesses can all benefit significantly from making use of indoor-space mobility data.\r\n\r\nAs increasing number of researches have been conducted on the management of indoor-space mobility data, we build this *Literature Repository* for the researchers or practitioners who are interested in such topics to explore freely. Wish you a good luck and enjoy it! \r\n\r\n## Proposes\r\n\r\n+ To give a brief review introduction to *indoor data management techniques*.\r\n+ To review a series of works in this \ffield, including their proposed *models*, *indexes* and *algorithms*.\r\n+ To discuss how to bring those advanced theoretical contents into practice.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\n### 1 Outlines\r\n\r\n### 2 Indoor Space Models and Applications\r\n\r\n#### 2.1 Graph Model Based Indoor Tracking\r\n#### 2.2 Scalable Continuous Range Monitoring of Moving Objects in Symbolic Indoor Space\r\n\r\n### 3 Indoor Data Cleansing\r\n\r\n### 4 Indoor Movement Analysis\r\n\r\n### 5 Appendix\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n+ Huan Li, Zhejiang University, China\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nEmail Address: lihuancs@zju.edu.cn",
