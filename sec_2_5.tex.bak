\emph{A Foundation for Efficient Indoor Distance-Aware Query Processing}.~\cite{DBLP:conf/icde/LuYCJ11} \\
H.~Lu, X.~Cao, and C.~S. Jensen.\\~\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Published at \emph{ICDE' 2012}.
  \item First time to propose a distance-aware indoor space model that integrates indoor distance seamlessly.
  \item Accompanying, efficient algorithms for computing indoor distances.
  \item Indexing framework that accommodates indoor distances.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A variety of LBS services are useful in indoor space.
    \begin{fitemize}
      \item a museum guidence service in a complex exhibition
      \item boarding reminder service in an airport, to remind the passengers especially those far away from their gates or departures
    \end{fitemize}

  \item Such indoor LBSs will benefit from the availability of accurate indoor distances.
    \begin{fitemize}
      \item indoor space entities enable as well as constrain indoor movement, thus makes traditional space model for Euclidean/spatial network spaces unsuitable.
      \item existing indoor space models~\cite{becker2005location, li2008lattice, becker2009multilayered} pay little attention to indoor distances.
    \end{fitemize}

\end{itemize}
