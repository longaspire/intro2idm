\emph{Probabilistic Threshold $k$ Nearest Neighbor Queries over Moving Objects in Symbolic Indoor Space}.~\cite{DBLP:conf/edbt/YangLJ10} \\
B.~Yang, H.~Lu, and C.~S. Jensen.\\~\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Published in year 2010 at the \emph{EDBT} conference.
  \item \emph{Minimal Indoor Walking Distance}(MIWD) along with algorithms and data structures are proposed for distance computing and storage.
  \item Effective object indexing structures, also capture the uncertainty of object locations.
  \item On this foundation, Probabilistic threshold $k$NN (PT$k$NN) query is studied.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Indoor positioning makes it possible to support interesting queries over large populations of moving objects.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item shopping mall, airports, office buildings
      \item $k$NN queries over indoor moving objects enables the detection of approaching potential threats at sensitive locations in a subway system
    \end{itemize}
  \\~\\
  \item Existing $k$NN techniques in spatial and spatialtemporal databases are inapplicable in indoor spaces.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item complex entities and topologies
      \item indoor positioning techniques differ fundamentally from outdoor GPS, low sampling frequency and accuracy
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
